- Perchè non hai usato un manager e hai fatto fare tutto all’emitter? Con il manager hai dei movimenti di dati in più? L’emitter ha qualche guadagno se c’è il manager?
- Perchè parti subito con un numero fissato di worker? Non sarebbe stato meglio farlo lavorare uno e poi capire quanti worker servono dinamicamente?
- Sarebbe stato giusto fare un’analisi del tempo che ci metto per fare uno switch del numero di worker in modo da capire ogni quanto cambiare
- Se ho due map quali ottimizzazioni posso fare? Se faccio la map fusion poi ho un guadagno? Ce l’ho sempre?
- Se metto una map dentro ad una farm che guadagno ho se aumento il numero di worker della map o se aumento il numero di worker della farm?
Se tolgo la map e lascio la farm aumentando i worker cambia qualcosa? L’efficiency come cambia? Se tolgo tutto e lascio solo un nodo sequenziale cambia qualcosa? L’efficiency come varia (diventa 1)?
- Differenza tra work span model e amdahl law, voleva sapere che i nodi devono avere lo stesso tempo di esecuzione
------------------------------
- Come si calcola lo speedup?
- Amdahl Law (con limite)
- Cosa devo aggiungere ad un farm che tenga in conto sia il tempo che il consumo energetico (considerando che entrambi dipendono dal nw)? Devo tenere conto di grado di parallelismo e frequenza del processore. Nel collector posso calcolare il service time Ts. Posso variare il numero di worker e vedere all'aumentare del nw come varia l'energia. Più worker = meno tempo di uso di CPU con più consumo. Posso fermarmi quando diventa sconveniente aumentare il nw per l'overhead.

- Why didn't you use a manager and have the emitter do everything? Do you have more data movements with the manager? Does the emitter have any earnings if there is a manager?
- Why do you start immediately with a fixed number of workers? Wouldn't it have been better to have him work one and then figure out how many workers they need dynamically?
- It would have been right to do an analysis of the time it takes to make a switch of the number of workers in order to understand how often to change
- If I have two maps, which optimizations can I do? If I do map fusion then do I have a profit? Do I always have it?
- If I put a map inside a farm, what profit do I have if I increase the number of workers on the map or if I increase the number of workers in the farm?
If I remove the map and leave the farm increasing the workers does something change? How does efficiency change? If I remove everything and leave only a sequential node, does something change? How does the efficiency vary (becomes 1)?
- Difference between work span model and amdahl law, he wanted to know that nodes must have the same execution time
------------------------------
- How is the speedup calculated?
- Amdahl Law (with limit)
- What should I add to a farm that takes into account both time and energy consumption (considering that both depend on the nw)? I have to take into account the degree of parallelism and the frequency of the processor. In the collector I can calculate the service time Ts. I can vary the number of workers and see how the energy changes as the nw increases. More worker = less CPU usage time with more consumption. I can stop when it becomes inconvenient to increase the nw for overhead.
- Types of patterns
